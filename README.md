# Final Project
### What is the project?
I am a person who loves convience, being lazy, and saving time. So I thought that I was a good idea to create a website that has convenient features for the user such as a stock lookup section or a password generator. 
Navigate through the website with the navbar or the links on the index page. Some history is logged, but can be cleared at any time. Enjoy the site, source code is included and can be viewed if you so wish.

### How to use
Setup for unix

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`

`export FLASK_APP=application`

`export FLASK_ENV=development`

`flask run`

Setup for windows

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`set FLASK_APP=application`

`set FLASK_ENV=development`

`flask run`

Update packages

`pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

## NOTE:
DO NOT USE THE PASSWORD MANAGER FOR YOUR REAL LIFE, THE MANAGER ON THE WEBSITE IS FAR LESS SECURE THAN OTHER PASSWORD MANAGERS THAT ALREADY EXIST AND WAS ONLY A FUN ADDITION TO THE PROJECT.
